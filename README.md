# VizForSocialGood

The goal of this project was to Visualise a subset of data 
collected during the Viz For Social Good community poll of November 2021.

A key success factor in VFSG engagementâ€™s is how well the volunteer 
community understands and connects with the cause being partnered with. 
To lay a strong foundation for this, the goal is to analyze the community 
base and identify where they should focus efforts for recruiting as well as 
what non-profits would be the strongest to partner with going forward.
